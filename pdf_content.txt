Monthly Sales Analysis (NumPy
Matplotlib + Seaborn)
Objective
The goal is to generate, analyze, and visualize monthly sales data for four products over one year,
and extract key business insights using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Instructions
1. Data Generation
.
Generate a series ofmonthly dates for one year (e.g., from '2025-01 -01' to '2025-12-01').
.
Define in utils.py a function generate_random_sales(min_vaI, max_vaI, size) that returns a random
NumPy array of integers between min_val and max_val for the given size.
.
Use this function to generate random monthly sales (integers) for 12 months for four products:
Product A: 50-100 units
Product B: 30-80 units
Product C: 20-60 units
Product D: 10-50 units
.
Create a Data Frame with columns: Date, Product_A, Product_B, Product_C, Product_D.
.
Save this initial dataset as initial . calv
2. Build Data Frame
.
.
Create a Pandas Data Frame with columns: Month , Product_A , Product_B , Product_C ,
Product_D.
Compute monthly metrics:
Total_sales : sum of all products per month
Average_Sales : mean sales per month
Month_over_Month_Growth : percent change of Total_sales vs previous month
.
Assign each month to a quarter:
# Main notebook with all analysis and visualizations
# Functions for data generation
# Raw generated dataset
# Data Frame with calculated metrics
# Final results including pivot tables
+ Pandas +
Q1: Jan-Mar, Q2: Apr-Jun, QUO: Jul-Sep, Q4: Oct-Dec
.
.
Add additional columns:
Max_Sales_product : product with the highest sales each month
Min_sales_product : product with the lowest sales each month
Save this updated Data Frame as Fina1.csv .
3. Pivot Tables & Summaries
.
.
.
Compute average sales per quarter for each product and total sales using a pivot table.
Compute total sales per quarter.
Save the final output including pivot tables as output . calv .
4. Key Insights
Identify the best month (highest total sales)
Identify the best product (highest cumulative annual sales)
Identify the best quarter (highest total sales)
5. Visualizations
.
.

.
Line chart for each product across months
Stacked bar chart oftotal monthly sales by product (annotate best month)
Seaborn heat rap: monthly sales ofeach product
Seaborn boxplot: distribution ofsales per product
6. Conclusion Questions
.
.
.
Which product contributes the most to overall sales throughout the year?
Which quarter performs best and why might that be?
How could this information be used to improve sales strategy for the next year?
